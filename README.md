## Report bugs!

My wow account is unsubbed for more than a year now and I'm getting out of touch with the game. I WILL NOT be able to spot bugs or errors by myself. I still aim to support the addon and keep it running however.

Please report errors/bugs if you find some so I can look into it 

# MoveTooltipLite

This is a small world of warcraft addon.  
It allows users to move the game tooltip position.

#### Commands

- /mtl unlock : Unlock the tooltip position
- /mtl reset : Fully reset addon data and tooltip position
